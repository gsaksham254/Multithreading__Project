Using Concept of Multi Threading and try to build a project as easy as possible..

MultiThreading:-Multithreading is a concept in computer science and software development that refers to the ability of an operating system or a program to execute multiple threads concurrently within a single process. A thread can be thought of as an independent sequence of instructions that can be scheduled and executed by the CPU.
Traditionally, programs were executed sequentially, meaning that each instruction had to be completed before moving on to the next one. However, with multithreading, different threads can run concurrently, allowing for improved performance and better resource utilization, especially in systems with multiple CPU cores.
Multithreading enables developers to write programs that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously or handle concurrent events effectively. Each thread within a process can have its own set of instructions, program counter, and stack, but they all share the same memory space. This shared memory allows threads to communicate and share data with each other easily, although it also introduces potential challenges such as race conditions and thread synchronization.

Thread:-A thread is a basic unit of execution within a process. It can be considered as a lightweight, independent sequence of instructions that can be scheduled and executed by the CPU. Threads share the same memory space within a process, allowing them to access and modify the same data.
Threads are commonly used in multithreading to achieve concurrent execution. By dividing a program into multiple threads, different parts of the program can be executed concurrently, potentially improving performance and responsiveness. Each thread has its own program counter, stack, and local variables, but they share the process's global variables and heap memory.
Threads can be created, started, paused, resumed, and terminated. They can also communicate and synchronize with each other through shared memory or explicit synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and condition variables. Proper thread synchronization is essential to prevent data races and ensure correct program execution.
Threads can be categorized into two main types:

User-Level Threads (ULTs): These threads are managed entirely by user-level libraries or runtime environments without direct support from the operating system kernel. ULTs provide flexibility and can be tailored to specific applications, but they rely on the program or library to manage thread scheduling and may not fully utilize multiple CPU cores.

Kernel-Level Threads (KLTs): These threads are managed and supported directly by the operating system kernel. The kernel schedules and manages KLTs, allowing them to run in parallel across multiple CPU cores. KLTs provide better performance for parallel execution but may have higher overhead due to kernel involvement.

Threads are widely used in various areas of computing, including application development, system programming, server architectures, and parallel processing. They enable concurrent execution, responsiveness, and efficient utilization of computing resources. However, proper thread management and synchronization are crucial to ensure thread safety and prevent issues like data corruption or race conditions.
